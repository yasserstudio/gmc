### Patch Changes

- e94a82c: feat(migrate): `gmc migrate feed-labels` — feed-label transfer check (Phase 5, v0.9.8)

  Closes Phase 5. Google Ads Shopping campaigns serve products by their feed identity `(channel, feedLabel, contentLanguage)` — the same tuple a primary data source is keyed by. After a Content API → Merchant API migration, a product whose feed identity matches no data source lands in a feed no campaign targets and silently stops serving. `gmc migrate feed-labels` catches that before push.
  - **Offline analysis** — groups the feed by feed identity, flags products with no `feedLabel`, and warns on case variants (`US` vs `us`, which Merchant Center treats as different feeds).
  - **Live cross-check** — when an account is resolved, lists the account's primary data sources and flags any group that matches none (the campaign-killer); also reports orphaned data sources. `--remote` checks the live catalog directly.
  - **CI gate** like `preflight` — exits non-zero on error findings; warnings gate only with `--strict`. Prints a feed-label distribution table (per group: product count + whether it matches a data source) or `--json`.

  The check lands in `@gmc-cli/migrate` (`checkFeedLabels`, pure). Together with `migrate scopes` (v0.9.6) and `migrate products` (v0.9.7), Phase 5 covers the full migration: auth, product data, and the feed-label safety net.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- dbd7901: feat(migrate): `gmc migrate products` — Content API v2.1 → Merchant API ProductInput (Phase 5, v0.9.7)

  Phase 5 part 2: convert real Content API for Shopping product data into push-ready Merchant API `ProductInput` files, so the output drops straight into `gmc feeds push` and `gmc preflight` — completing the migrate → validate → upload pipeline.

  `gmc migrate products`:
  - **Input** — `--from <dir>` of per-product Content API JSON, or `--file <path>` for a single product, a JSON array, or a `products.list` response (`{resources}`/`{products}`).
  - **Transform** — moves descriptive fields into `attributes`, keeps identity fields (`offerId`/`channel`/`contentLanguage`/`feedLabel`) at the top level, and remaps: price `{value,currency}` → `{amountMicros,currencyCode}` (BigInt, half-up at 6 dp; also `salePrice` and nested `shipping[].price`), `availability` enum spaces → underscores (`in stock` → `in_stock`), `targetCountry` → `feedLabel`, and the Content API REST `id` parsed to backfill identity then dropped. Output-only fields (`id`/`kind`/`source`) are dropped and reported.
  - **Output** — `--out <dir>` (default `feeds`) of `ProductInput` files named like `feeds pull`, plus a migration report (converted / remapped / dropped / warnings) or `--json`. Exits non-zero if any product can't be converted, so CI gates an incomplete migration.

  The transform engine lands in `@gmc-cli/migrate` (which gains a direct `@gmc-cli/api` dependency for the product types). The per-product filename helper is shared with `feeds pull` via `_shared.ts`.
