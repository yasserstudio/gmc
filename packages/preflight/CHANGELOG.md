## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b187945: feat(preflight): offline feed-compliance engine + `gmc preflight` (v0.9.3)

  Adds `@gmc-cli/preflight`, a pure rule engine that scans product inputs for
  Merchant Center compliance issues **offline** — no API call, no auth — and the
  `gmc preflight` command that runs it.
  - `gmc preflight [--dir <path>]` scans a directory of `feeds pull` files; `--file`
    scans one file; `--remote` pulls the live catalog and scans it.
  - `.gmcpreflightrc` (discovered by walking up from the scanned directory, or via
    `--config`) sets per-rule severities, an `ignore` list, `targetCountry`, and
    `strict`. `--strict` treats warnings as failures.
  - Findings carry a severity (`error`/`warning`/`info`), the offending attribute,
    a fix suggestion, and a docs link — and group by product in human output or
    serialize to a full report under `--json`.
  - New exit code `6` (`ExitCode.Preflight`) when gating findings are present, so CI
    can fail a build before a bad feed is uploaded.

  Ships the engine, the `.gmcpreflightrc` loader, and a seed rule set
  (`required.offer-id`, `required.title`, `required.price`). The full required /
  format rule library lands in v0.9.4 and policy / disapproval-trigger checks in
  v0.9.5.
