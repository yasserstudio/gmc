feat(cli): `gmc feeds diff` — preview what `push` would change vs the live catalog. Classifies each product (matched by composite id, filename-independent) as added / updated / unchanged / orphaned (catalog-only, which push never removes). Read-only; differences exit 0, an invalid local file exits 1. Closes out Phase 3 (feeds as code). The shared directory-load loop is factored out of `push` into `loadProductFiles`.
