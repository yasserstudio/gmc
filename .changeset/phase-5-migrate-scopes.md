feat(migrate): `gmc migrate scopes` — Content API → Merchant API auth migration (Phase 5, v0.9.6)

Introduces the new `@gmc-cli/migrate` engine and the `gmc migrate` command group, opening Phase 5 — the Content API for Shopping → Merchant API assistant (the Content API retires Aug 18, 2026).

`gmc migrate scopes` does two things:

- **Audits auth readiness.** The Merchant API uses the same OAuth scope as the Content API (`auth/content`), so existing tokens keep working with no re-consent — the report makes that explicit and maps the per-sub-API scope model for when Google ships granular scopes. The real blockers (GCP project registration + Merchant API enablement) are checked with a best-effort live probe, the same one behind `gmc doctor`; it degrades to a warning mid-migration rather than failing.
- **Migrates a legacy config.** `--from merchant-info.json` (or `-a <id>`) seeds a `gmc` profile. Dry-run by default; `--write` applies it, `--set-default` makes it the default. It's an assistant, not a CI gate — advisory findings still exit `0`.

`@gmc-cli/config` gains `saveConfig` and `upsertProfile` — the first config-writing API, with atomic, owner-only writes that preserve existing profiles. `@gmc-cli/auth` adds the `datasources` sub-API to `SubApi` (aligning with `@gmc-cli/api`) and exports a canonical `SUB_APIS` list.
